# GPIO Module for RISC-V SoC

This repository contains a Verilog-based General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) module designed for integration with a RISC-V System-on-Chip (SoC). It supports essential GPIO operations such as input/output direction control, reading/writing pin values, and interrupt handling.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `gpio_final.v` – Verilog implementation of the GPIO module
- `tb_combined.v` – Testbench file for simulation and verification
- `EE705_Project_1.pdf` – Detailed project report describing design, functionality, and results

## 🔧 Features

- 32 GPIO pins with individual control
- Configurable direction (input/output) for each pin
- Input reading and output writing support
- Interrupt support for input events
